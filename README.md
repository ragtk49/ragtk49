**`Software Engineer(FullStack/Java)`**

I am an experienced full-stack developer who is excited to build innovative solutions to complex problems. I love to explore different technologies and experiment with them to get hands-on and be relevant in the current scene. Creating new applications from scratch is fun and a great learning opportunity.
